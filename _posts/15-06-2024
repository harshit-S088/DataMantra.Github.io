What are Semi, Anti, and Natural Joins in SQL?

We all have heard of LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, INNER JOIN, and OUTER JOIN, haven’t we?

Here’s a short description:-

Inner Join: Returns only matching rows from both tables.
Left Join: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right. Non-matching rows from the left table contain null values.
Right Join: Returns all rows from the right tables and matching rows from the left. Non-matching rows from the right table contain null values.
Full Outer Join: Returns all rows when a match is in either table. Non-matching rows contain null values.
